Code for Smith et al 2019

Genetics of shoot branching plasticity in Brachypodium dystachion

Contains code to reproduce analysis of the paper.

Open RStudio project (`BrachyRILs.Rproj` file), and define all paths relative to
the root directory of the project.

Directory structure:

```
project
├── data                - this will eventually live in an external repository
│   ├── external        - data from external sources (e.g. RIL genotypes)
│   ├── intermediate    - intermediate data that we may not need to share
│   ├── processed       - processed (clean) data that we might want to share
│   └── raw             - original, uncleaned, data (CSV format)
├── figures             - pdf files with figures generated by respective scripts
├── notebooks           - Rmarkdown documents with exploratory analysis
└── scripts             - R scripts with core analysis
    ├── data_processing - to process data, e.g. raw -> clean phenotypes
    ├── model_fitting   - to fit models (e.g. QTL and GxE models)
    └── paper_figures   - to create paper figures
```

Script naming conventions:

- Notebooks: person initials, 2-digit number, short description, e.g.
`ht-01_explore_qtl_models.Rmd`, `mvr-01_explore_phenotypes.Rmd`
  - these can be knitted as html in the same directory
- Data processing scripts: 2-digit number, short description, e.g.
`01_clean_phenotypes.R`, `02_summarise_phenotypes.R`
- figures scripts: figure number using two digits, and appending "S" for
supplementary, e.g.: `Fig01.R`, `Fig02.R`, `S01Fig.R`
  - these should output a PDF file named `Fig01.pdf`, etc. to the `./figures/` folder.
  - these might later be processed in _inkscape_ or _illustrator_.
- model_fitting scripts: 2-digit number, short description, e.g.
`01_GxE_phenotype_lmm.R`, `02_simple_qtl.R`, `03_GxE_qtl.R`
